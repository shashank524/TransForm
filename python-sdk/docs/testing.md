# Testing MCP Servers

The Python SDK provides a `Client` class for testing MCP servers with an in-memory transport.
This makes it easy to write tests without network overhead.

## Basic Usage

Let's assume you have a simple server with a single tool:

```python title="server.py"
from mcp.server import MCPServer

app = MCPServer("Calculator")

@app.tool()
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers."""  # (1)!
    return a + b
```

1. The docstring is automatically added as the description of the tool.

To run the below test, you'll need to install the following dependencies:

=== "pip"
    ```bash
    pip install inline-snapshot pytest
    ```

=== "uv"
    ```bash
    uv add inline-snapshot pytest
    ```

!!! info
    I think [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) is a pretty standard testing framework,
    so I won't go into details here.

    The [`inline-snapshot`](https://15r10nk.github.io/inline-snapshot/latest/) is a library that allows
    you to take snapshots of the output of your tests. Which makes it easier to create tests for your
    server - you don't need to use it, but we are spreading the word for best practices.

```python title="test_server.py"
import pytest
from inline_snapshot import snapshot
from mcp import Client
from mcp.types import CallToolResult, TextContent

from server import app


@pytest.fixture
def anyio_backend():  # (1)!
    return "asyncio"


@pytest.fixture
async def client():  # (2)!
    async with Client(app, raise_exceptions=True) as c:
        yield c


@pytest.mark.anyio
async def test_call_add_tool(client: Client):
    result = await client.call_tool("add", {"a": 1, "b": 2})
    assert result == snapshot(
        CallToolResult(
            content=[TextContent(type="text", text="3")],
            structuredContent={"result": 3},
        )
    )
```

1. If you are using `trio`, you should set `"trio"` as the `anyio_backend`. Check more information in the [anyio documentation](https://anyio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/testing.html#specifying-the-backends-to-run-on).
2. The `client` fixture creates a connected client that can be reused across multiple tests.

There you go! You can now extend your tests to cover more scenarios.
